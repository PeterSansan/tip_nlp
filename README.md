### - SVD.

The part introduces how to use SVD to simplify data set, including comparing similarity by **euclidean distance**, **Pearson's correlation coefficient**, **Cosine similarity**. refer to:http://blog.csdn.net/peng825223208/article/details/38292859. But This a question left here: Why the U matrix can change origin matrix to low dimension matrix.
